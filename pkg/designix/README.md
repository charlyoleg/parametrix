========


Presentation
------------

*Designix* is a *javascript* package containing a couple of programmatic CAD designs based on *Geometrix*. Those designs are used to illustrate the usage of *Geometrix* and *Parametrix* and to help at their development.
The goals is that *programmatic CAD designers* develop their own *designix* package.


Getting started
---------------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charlyoleg/parametrix
cd parametrix
npm -w designix install
npm -w designix ci
```

Dependencies
------------

*Designix* runtime depends only on *Geometrix*. Use *Parametrix* UI or *Parametrix-cli* to visualize and export the designs in different formats like dxf, svg and others.
